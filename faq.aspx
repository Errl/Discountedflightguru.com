							<h3>Frequently asked Questions</h3>
							<p><span class="faqbold">Why book with DiscountedFlightGuru.com?</span></> 
                                
                    Our focus is on the customer. We will do whatever it takes to make sure you are getting the cheapest business class airfare available.
                            Our prices are typically 50-70% cheaper than our competition. 
				</p>
						<p><span class="faqbold">Once booked, can I change or cancel my ticket?</span> 
                   You may change your flight for a fee if done so at least 72 hours before your original departure date.
                            If you wish to cancel your flight there is a fee of $200, which will give you a credit with us for up 
                            to 365 days from original purchase date. If you wish to change your ticket there is a fee of $100 plus any difference in 
                            fare if the price of new flight is higher. Any changes are subject to availability.

                        <p><span class="faqbold">What is an E-Ticket?</span> 
                   An electronic ticket is the time-saving, ticketless way to travel! An e-ticket, also known as electronic ticketing,
                            allows your entire experience to be easy, safe and electronic, which means no more paper tickets. 
                            Your ticket is stored in our system, and the airlines computer system, waiting for you when you arrive at the airport.
				</p>
<p><span class="faqbold">Can I get a seat for my baby?</span> 
                    
                            Most airlines will let you purchase a seat for an infant, but you will need to pay a child’s fare. 
                            Some airlines will not allow an infant on a separate seat at all. Please check with an agent. 
				</p>
                        <p><span class="faqbold">What happens if I miss my flight?</span> 
                  Although DiscountedFlightGuru.com is not responsable for any missed flights, we do pride ourselves
            on customer service and emergency, last minute travel. You should contact your agent and office as soon as possible, so one of 
            our experts can help you out. Missed flights are subject to the individual rules and regulations of the operating airline.

                        <p><span class="faqbold">Can I book tickets online?</span> 
                   Though you can plan a trip online and see ticket prices, you must confirm by calling us at 888 586 8583. 
            Your ticket will be booked within 24 hours of payment, and you will be sent an eTicket. Note: Ticket prices are not guaranteed until purchased.
				</p>
                        <p><span class="faqbold">What kind of extra discounts can I get for children/seniors/military/etc.?</span> 
                   Infants/Children discounts: The fare for infants under the age of 2 is usually 20% of an adult fare, plus taxes and fees.
            Due to our already discounted prices we are unable to offer discounts on tickets for children over 2 years old. Please check with us to confirm any discount information. 
            Senior/Military discounts: We do not have additional discounts for seniors, primarily because our tickets are already deeply discounted. 
				</p>
                        <p><span class="faqbold">What about Passports and Visas?</span> 
                    
                             DiscountedFlightGuru.com is not responsible for any passport or visa issues. We are only responsible for issuing and confirming tickets. 
            Please make sure that you have all of the necessary documents before purchasing your tickets. If your tickets need to be cancelled or changed due to passport or visa issues, the cancellation/date change penalties will apply. 
           <span class="faqbold"> Be sure you have a signed, valid passport and visas, if required. </span>
